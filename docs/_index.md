The goal for this project is to build a simple point and shoot digital camera, that we can use when travelling or just at home. 

Given the number of cheap microcontrollers, tiny cameras and screens available today it may seem like creating a simple point-and-shoot camera would be easy and internet would be flooded with similar projects. However this turned out to be an interesting non-trivial project with many design considerations and limitations to work around.
